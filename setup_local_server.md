# Setup Local Server

1. Open `acServerManager.exe`
2. Click on Update Server Content
3. If your server is running on remote PC, upload the entire `server` folder.
   - Remember to backup the three files listed in the section below: in this case just check for new settings in the new files and add them to your old ones.
   - If you want, you can also run `acServerManager.exe` with `/pack /nomsg` as arguments to have the same result of points 2 and 3 with no window.
